# Python-BANGALORE-HOUSE-PRICES
This project aims to perform an in-depth analysis of the Bangalore House Prices dataset to gain insights into housing trends in Bangalore.
Project Steps:

Data Acquisition:

Obtain the "Bangalore House Prices" dataset.
Load the dataset into a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).
Data Preprocessing:

Check for missing values and handle them appropriately (e.g., imputation or removal).
Clean and transform the data as needed (e.g., convert data types, handle outliers).
Perform feature engineering if required.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python:

Generate summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).
Visualize data distributions using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
Explore relationships between variables.
Identify outliers and decide whether to remove or transform them.
Perform statistical tests and hypothesis testing if relevant.

Data Visualization with Power BI:

Import the cleaned dataset into Power BI.
Create interactive visualizations:
Price distribution across different area types.
Availability of properties over time.
Location-based insights (e.g., average price by location).
Size-wise analysis of properties.
